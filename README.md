# Early-Detection-of-FMD-in-cattle-Using-Machine-Learning

## Project Summary

This project focuses on the early detection of Bovine Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) by applying machine learning and statistical modeling techniques to livestock field data.
Using R, the analysis identifies key risk factors associated with FMD infection and evaluates multiple classification models to support timely disease surveillance and control.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. FMD Prevalence Rate (%)
2. Model Accuracy
3. Sensitivity (Recall) – ability to correctly detect infected cattle
4. Specificity – ability to correctly identify non-infected cattle
5. F1 Score
6. Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)
7. Top Predictive Risk Factors

Target Variable: FMD_Status (Positive / Negative)
Predictor Variables:
1. Location: Districts, Kebeles
2. Animal factors: Breed, Sex, Age, Body Condition, Physiology
